World JS: Evolution Simulator
========

**Live Demo:** http://anvoz.github.io/world-js/
![Version 2.1 screenshot on medium screen size](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4688035/1219134/f2a1be04-26c5-11e3-8a8b-84505d67ce3d.png "Version 2.1 screenshot on medium screen size")

## TODO (version 3.0)

* Change the project name: possibly replace "evolution" with "history".
* Not start the game on page loaded: the main screen displays a short introduction of history (from the Big Bang to the time when the game start) and a "Start" button.
* Food resource re-fills with a fixed number every Y years, enough to maintain a low population.
* Be able to manually adjust the population limit (still need to complete a knowledge to increase the max value).
* Be able to forbid a knowledge if the population is lower than X number: knowledge that has been forbidden for Y years will be completely removed.
* Simulate the agricultural revolution with 4 core knowledge: "domesticating plants and animals", "settling down", "imaginary order" and "writing".
